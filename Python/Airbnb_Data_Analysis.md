##Airbnb Dataset Analysis and Visualization
This project, implemented in Python using Google Colab, focuses on analyzing and visualizing the Airbnb dataset. The dataset contains information about various Airbnb listings in Amsterdam. The goal of this project is to process the dataset, perform calculations, and create an interactive app for visualizing the data geographically.

Project Overview
Downloading and preprocessing the dataset
Cleaning the data and transforming it into a suitable format
Performing calculations and currency conversion
Adjusting prices for inflation
Selecting a preferred location in Amsterdam
Calculating the distance between the preferred location and available Airbnb listings
Visualizing the dataset using Streamlit
Project Tasks
Find the delimiter in the CSV file and format the data appropriately.
Remove irrelevant rows and columns from the dataset.
Rearrange the dataset to its original format.
Filter out string characters from the dataset.
Verify the dataset to ensure no string characters remain.
Change the data type of the dataset to enable numerical operations.
Choose a currency for conversion and apply the currency conversion to the prices.
Find the 2022 annual inflation rate for the chosen currency and adjust the prices accordingly.
Round the prices to two decimal places.
Select a preferred location in Amsterdam (latitude and longitude) for further analysis.
Calculate the distance between the preferred location and available Airbnb listings.
Visualize the dataset using Streamlit, including price display and color-coding based on category.
