# Pankti Rana - Data Analytics portfolio

## Welcome to my GitHub repository!

This repository showcases my data analytics skills through small projects using [SQL](https://github.com/panktir/Data-Analytics/tree/main/SQL), [R](https://github.com/panktir/Data-Analytics/tree/main/R), and [Tableau](https://github.com/panktir/Data-Analytics/tree/main/Tableau). Each project in this repository includes a dataset and a set of questions to answer using one or more of these tools. The projects range in difficulty, but all are designed to demonstrate my ability to manipulate data, perform analysis, and visualize results.

Please note that these are ongoing projects and I will be updating it as I learn more about data analytics. I encourage you to explore the code and visualizations, and to provide feedback and suggestions for improvement. 

Thank you!
